# Random_Forest_Classifier
Python code for the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to predict multiclass medical diagnosis, with alpha optimization and features selection


The classifier operates on the dataset "CTG_raw.xls" wich reports raw data from an open source dataset, which is available at the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography
Data is composed by 21 features from preprocessed 2126 fetal heart rate signals, and 1 categorical dependent variables representing 3 classes of fetus status (1 = normal; 2 = suspect; 3 = pathologic)

Suggestion: for the best performance the code should be opened with Spyder, since it has been written in sequential cells (starting with: #%% )
